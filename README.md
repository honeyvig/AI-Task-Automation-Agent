# AI-Task-Automation-Agent
build an AI agent that can autonomously execute a customizable sequence of tasks. The AI agent should allow users to define and initiate tasks (e.g., data search, communication, reporting) in a sequential, automated flow.

Responsibilities:

Create a configurable AI agent to handle a user-defined task sequence.
Integrate APIs for communication tools (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid).
Ensure smooth, sequential execution with error handling and monitoring.
-------------------------
Creating an AI agent that can autonomously execute a customizable sequence of tasks involves defining a system that allows users to specify a series of actions, which are then executed in a sequence. This agent should support integration with APIs for communication tools (like Twilio and SendGrid), and be capable of handling errors and monitoring task execution.

Here's a Python code implementation that achieves this:
Prerequisites:

Before running the code, install the necessary libraries:

pip install twilio sendgrid

Step-by-Step Approach:

    Define Tasks: The AI agent will execute a sequence of tasks. These tasks could be defined as actions, such as sending a message, searching for data, or generating reports.

    Error Handling: Each task should have error handling to ensure that if one task fails, the rest of the tasks can still execute, or the system logs the failure and attempts recovery.

    Communication APIs Integration: Use Twilio for sending SMS messages and SendGrid for sending emails.

    Task Execution Flow: The AI agent will be able to take a sequence of tasks from the user, execute them in order, and provide feedback about success or failure.

Python Code:

import time
import logging
from twilio.rest import Client
import sendgrid
from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail, Email, To, Content

# Configure logging for task tracking
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Task executor class
class AIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
        self.results = []
        
    # Method to add tasks to the agent
    def add_task(self, task_func, *args, **kwargs):
        self.tasks.append((task_func, args, kwargs))
    
    # Execute tasks in sequence
    def execute_tasks(self):
        for i, (task_func, args, kwargs) in enumerate(self.tasks):
            try:
                logging.info(f"Executing Task {i + 1}...")
                result = task_func(*args, **kwargs)
                self.results.append(result)
                logging.info(f"Task {i + 1} completed successfully.")
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"Task {i + 1} failed with error: {str(e)}")
                self.results.append(f"Error in Task {i + 1}: {str(e)}")
    
    # Show task results
    def get_results(self):
        return self.results

# Define a task to send an SMS using Twilio
def send_sms_twilio(to, body, from_):
    try:
        # Twilio API setup
        account_sid = 'your_account_sid'  # Replace with your Twilio account SID
        auth_token = 'your_auth_token'  # Replace with your Twilio Auth Token
        client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

        message = client.messages.create(
            body=body,
            from_=from_,
            to=to
        )
        return f"SMS sent successfully to {to} with SID {message.sid}"
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to send SMS: {str(e)}")

# Define a task to send an email using SendGrid
def send_email_sendgrid(to_email, subject, content, from_email="your_email@example.com"):
    try:
        # SendGrid API setup
        sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key="your_sendgrid_api_key")  # Replace with your SendGrid API Key
        from_email = Email(from_email)
        to_email = To(to_email)
        content = Content("text/plain", content)

        mail = Mail(from_email, to_email, subject, content)
        response = sg.send(mail)
        
        return f"Email sent successfully to {to_email} with status {response.status_code}"
    except Exception as e:
        raise Exception(f"Failed to send Email: {str(e)}")

# Define a task to simulate data search (e.g., mock task)
def data_search(query):
    # Simulate a search (this could be replaced by an actual data search logic)
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate time taken to perform a search
    return f"Search for '{query}' completed. Found relevant data."

# Define a task to simulate generating a report (e.g., mock task)
def generate_report(report_type):
    # Simulate generating a report (this could be replaced by actual report generation logic)
    time.sleep(3)  # Simulate time taken to generate report
    return f"{report_type} report generated successfully."

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create an AI agent
    agent = AIAgent()

    # Add tasks to the agent
    agent.add_task(send_sms_twilio, '+1234567890', 'Hello from AI Agent!', '+0987654321')  # Send SMS
    agent.add_task(send_email_sendgrid, 'recipient@example.com', 'AI Task Completed', 'Hello, your task is completed.')  # Send Email
    agent.add_task(data_search, 'AI-driven marketing automation tools')  # Simulate data search
    agent.add_task(generate_report, 'Monthly Performance')  # Simulate report generation

    # Execute tasks
    agent.execute_tasks()

    # Get and log results
    results = agent.get_results()
    logging.info(f"All Task Results: {results}")

Key Points:

    AI Agent Class:
        The AIAgent class is responsible for managing the tasks. It maintains a list of tasks and results.
        The add_task method allows users to define a new task with its respective arguments.
        The execute_tasks method iterates over the tasks and executes them sequentially, logging the results or errors.
        The get_results method returns the results of all executed tasks.

    Twilio Task (send_sms_twilio):
        Uses the Twilio API to send an SMS. You'll need to replace the placeholder Twilio credentials (your_account_sid and your_auth_token) with actual credentials.

    SendGrid Task (send_email_sendgrid):
        Uses the SendGrid API to send an email. You'll need to replace the SendGrid API key (your_sendgrid_api_key) with a valid key.

    Mock Tasks (data_search and generate_report):
        These are simple tasks to simulate actual business logic like searching data and generating reports. They include a sleep delay to simulate task execution.

    Error Handling:
        Each task is wrapped in a try-except block. If an error occurs during task execution, itâ€™s logged, and the agent continues with the next task.

    Logging:
        Python's built-in logging module is used to track the progress and status of each task.

How to Use:

    Replace the API Keys: Make sure to replace the placeholders for Twilio and SendGrid with your actual credentials.
    Modify Tasks: Add more tasks as per your business needs by defining new functions and adding them to the agent using add_task.
    Run the Script: Execute the script, and the agent will perform all tasks in the defined sequence.

Extension Ideas:

    User Interface: This can be extended with a simple web interface (using Flask or Django) where users can define the tasks they want the agent to perform.
    Data Persistence: Store the task results in a database or a log file for tracking and reporting.
    Monitoring: Use a tool like Celery for task scheduling and monitoring, or integrate with cloud-based task management systems.

This solution provides a scalable, customizable AI agent that autonomously handles a sequence of tasks, integrates with external APIs, and logs results for easy monitoring and error handling.
